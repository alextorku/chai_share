# Reusable Kaldi Scripts

The best way to learn about these scripts is to read them, or to run them without any parameters to print the usage message.

## Prerequisite

### Kaldi

Follow the instructions [here](../ivector#kaldi) to setup Kaldi.

### Dataset Preparation

Some degree of manual data preparation is needed to use these scripts. The process itself is fairly involved and we assume that the directories follow the same convention defined in the Kaldi tutorial. To learn more, please see:
